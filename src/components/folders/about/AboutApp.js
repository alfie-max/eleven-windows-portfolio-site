                                My first interaction with code was in 2009 when
                                I created my first website, back then I was not
                                thinking that I can do my living from it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2017 I saw an ad on Facebook about a
                                scholarship program to learn web development. I
                                read some information about that and I
                                registered for the scholarship. One month passed
                                and they announced the people selected for this
                                program -- 60,000 out of the 200,000 registered.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The funny part of this is that I received an
                                email telling me that I was not selected for
                                this program, and I felt so bad in that day. But
                                the very next day they send me a second email
                                telling me that the first email was a mistake
                                and I was selected.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The scholarship start date came and , after a
                                few weeks Iâ€™ve learned so much and was so
                                motivated to learn more about programing, that I
                                completed the 3 month scholarship program in
                                only 1 month. The course was so well put
                                together and the community always there to help
                                when I got stuck in some quizzes.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When the scholarship was over, the next step was
                                to announce the recipients of a 6 months
                                nanodegree program. That day was the longest day
                                of my life. The email came telling me that I was
                                one of the 10% of 60,000 people who moved on to
                                phase 2 of the scholarship -- 6 months of
                                learning Front-End Web Development. It was the
                                best thing that happened to me, and for this I
                                want to thank Udacity for showing me a path to
                                follow, that I had not seen before, and did not
                                know existed.
